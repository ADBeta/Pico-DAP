# Pico-DAP
Pico-DAP is a CMSIS-DAP and Virtual COM Port (VCP) Device for programming
ARM based Microcontrollers, based on the `RP2040` Raspberry Pi Pico 
architecture, using the Pico-SDK toolchain.  

This reason for this project is to perfect the CMSIS-DAP device handling for
one specific device, without the worry of porting in the future.  
The project is open to the community and any ideas you have.  

## PCBs

## TODO
* Move free-dap to a Pico-SDK Project
* Make a PCB for the regular Pico
* Make a PCB for a bare RP2040

## Possible Changed
* Add CH32V SWIO Support
* Make specific JTAG USB Adatper
