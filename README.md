# Pico-DAP
Pico-DAP is a CMSIS-DAP and Virtual COM Port (VCP) Device for programming
ARM based Microcontrollers, based on the `RP2040` Raspberry Pi Pico 
architecture, using the Pico-SDK toolchain.  

This reason for this project is to perfect the CMSIS-DAP device handling for
one specific device, without the worry of porting in the future.  
The project is open to the community and any ideas you have.
